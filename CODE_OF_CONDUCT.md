# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Being patient and understanding with those learning or contributing for the first time
* Acknowledging and respecting the time and effort of volunteers

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Discrimination based on protected characteristics
* Threats of violence or violent language
* Unwelcome political advocacy or discussion
* Spam or excessive self-promotion

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **conduct@do-it.app** or through the private reporting feature on GitHub.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Reporting Guidelines

When reporting, please include:

* Your contact information
* Names/usernames of individuals involved
* Description of the behavior and its impact
* Where the behavior occurred (issue, PR, discussion, etc.)
* Any relevant context or additional information
* Whether you believe the issue is ongoing

## Investigation Process

1. **Initial Response**: We acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We conduct a fair and thorough investigation
3. **Determination**: We determine if a violation occurred
4. **Resolution**: We take appropriate action
5. **Follow-up**: We follow up with both parties where appropriate

## Consequences

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals

If a participant believes a decision has been made in error, they may appeal by:

1. Submitting a written appeal to **conduct@do-it.app**
2. Clearly stating why they believe the decision was inappropriate
3. Providing any additional context or evidence

Appeals will be reviewed by a different member of the project team. The decision on appeal will be final.
